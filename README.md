# MNIST_Demo
___
## Intro to problem
This is a demo I made in Colab to display CNNs and the modern deep learning toolbox.

It leverages the famous MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits (0-9).

## My own motivation

This is a classic demonstration of leveraging CNNs. The point of this exercise is for me to summarize my thoughts and understanding of CNNs. It is also to make sure I know every step of the model development, evaluation, and training process so I can diagnose issues with models I am implementing **easily**.

As AI tools are becoming better at PyTorch and there's increasingly more code online to reference/leverage for projects, I have found it can be too easy to get lazy and rely to heavily on these tools. I'm all for efficient development and using the tools available, but for my own personal use, I want to make sure I understand everything that's going on. This repo will serve as future reference for myself (and others!) when wanting to understand the model development process.

## Repo structure

There's just one notebook where I have my model, documentation, results, and ablations. Enjoy!
